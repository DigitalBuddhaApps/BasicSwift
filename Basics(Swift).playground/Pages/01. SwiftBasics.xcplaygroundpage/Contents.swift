// Naming Conventions

// Camel Case - CORRECT!
// The first word is lowercased and then the first character in every following word is uppercased.
let firstGreeting = "Hello, world!"
let thisIsMyFirstGreeting = "Hello, world!"
let thisIsMySecondGreeting = "Hello, world!"

// Snake Case -> wrong way to use
let this_is_what_snake_case_looks_like = "Hello, world!"

// Pascal Case -> wrong way to use
let ThisIsWhatPascalCaseLooksLike = "Hello, world!"
